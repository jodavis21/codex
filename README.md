# Codex

This repository contains a tiny Python script, `codex_demo.py`, that can
be used to demonstrate Codex or similar AI-powered coding assistants.

It also includes `morning_affirmations.py`, an interactive prompt that
asks how you're doing and responds with five upbeat affirmations tailored
to gently lift your energy.

```bash
python codex_demo.py "Codex makes writing helper scripts easy!"

# Start the morning affirmation companion
python morning_affirmations.py
```

The demo program prints a short report showing basic statistics about the
provided text, keeping the example approachable for live demos. The
affirmation companion offers a conversational boost based on your reply.
