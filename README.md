# Codex

This repository contains a tiny Python script, `codex_demo.py`, that can
be used to demonstrate Codex or similar AI-powered coding assistants.

```bash
python codex_demo.py "Codex makes writing helper scripts easy!"
```

The program prints a short report showing basic statistics about the
provided text, keeping the example approachable for live demos.
